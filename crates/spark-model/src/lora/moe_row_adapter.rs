//! Feature-1 MoE-LoRA per-request routing primitives (pure, GPU-free).
//!
//! Two host-side building blocks that keep the MoE fold correct in a mixed
//! batch without leaking a host D2H into the fold hot path:
//!
//! - [`resolve_moe_lora_route`] — the request-granularity fold decision used by
//!   `TransformerModel::moe_lora_route`. Base / non-active requests SKIP (pay
//!   nothing); the active-adapter request FOLDs; anything the single-active
//!   phase-1 fold cannot serve REFUSES loudly. This is the correctness core of
//!   the zero-overhead-when-a-request-opts-out invariant, unit-tested here.
//! - [`build_moe_row_adapter_host`] — the `[total_tokens]` per-packed-row
//!   adapter map (`< 0` = base) the device-side grouped fold (`lora-solid.md`
//!   Incr 1/3) will consume as a fixed-address kernel arg. It is built the same
//!   way the attention `seq_slot` buffer is (`slot_math::build_seq_slot_host`),
//!   keyed off `cu_seqlens_host` (the packing SSOT = Σ proc_count), NOT
//!   `b * chunk_len`, so varlen + partial-prefix-cache-hit batches stay aligned.
//!   The device consumption is the documented follow-up; the builder is landed +
//!   tested now so the row map is a solved, verified primitive.
