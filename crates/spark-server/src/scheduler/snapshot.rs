//! Per-tick scheduler observability snapshot.
//!
//! The model + all scheduler state live on a dedicated OS thread and are
//! thread-local by design; nothing outside could observe active sequences, KV
//! pressure, or the MTP gate. This module publishes one small `Copy` struct
//! per loop tick — a single uncontended `parking_lot` lock + memcpy, which is
//! unmeasurable against a multi-millisecond decode step — for the TUI (and
//! any future observer) to read.
//!
//! Global-static publication (not a channel) matches the established pattern
//! of `scheduler/helpers.rs` and avoids widening `scheduler::run`'s already
//! huge signature.
