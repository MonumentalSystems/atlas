"""
Cross-request BLEED + corruption detector for a running Atlas server.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Single-request probes cannot see the failure mode that matters most in
production: one request's content surfacing in ANOTHER request's response.
That was observed live (an agentic client received text from an unrelated
concurrent request), and no existing harness could reproduce it on demand.

HOW IT WORKS
------------
Each concurrent worker owns a UNIQUE canary token and a UNIQUE topic, and its
prompt asks for its own canary back. Verdicts per response:

  OK       answer contains ITS OWN canary and number
  TYPO     canary MISSPELLED but number correct — a model spelling artefact on an
           invented token, explicitly NOT corruption (see `_near`)
  PARTIAL  own canary, wrong number
  WRONG    no canary / wrong value        -> model weakness OR corruption
  BLEED    contains ANOTHER worker's canary or topic
           -> cross-request contamination. This is the smoking gun.

A SOLO reference pass runs every prompt sequentially first. That separates
"the model is weak on this prompt" from "concurrency corrupts it": a prompt
that is OK alone and WRONG/BLEED under load is an engine bug, not the model.

USAGE
-----
  python3 bench/conc_bleed.py <model> [concurrency] [rounds]

  PORT=8888          server port
  THINK=1            enable thinking (default OFF — see below)
  THINK_BUDGET=2048  per-request thinking budget, Anthropic-style
                     {"thinking":{"budget_tokens":N}}; implies THINK=1
  MAXTOK=200         max_tokens per request
  TOOLS=1            attach a tool schema and scan tool-call arguments too
  EXACT=1            deterministic-answer mode; the SENSITIVE bleed detector
  STREAM=1           use the SSE streaming endpoint — a DIFFERENT code path from
                     blocking, and the one agentic clients actually use
  PREFIX_WORDS=6000  shared-prefix length; MUST exceed the Marconi checkpoint
                     interval (4096 tokens) or the SSM snapshot path is never hit

Run it BOTH ways. Thinking ON and OFF exercise different code paths, and
thinking materially changes the result: with thinking ON and a small
max_tokens, several models spend the entire budget reasoning and return EMPTY
content, which scores WRONG and would MASK real bleed. Measured on Holo 3.1:
0/8 solo with thinking on, 8/8 solo with it off, same build, same prompts.
That is why thinking defaults to OFF here — a harness that cannot establish a
clean solo baseline cannot detect anything.

THE TRIGGER IS A SHARED PREFIX
------------------------------
Back-to-back on ONE Laguna-XS container, same detector, only prompt shape differs:

    DISTINCT prompts (PREFIX_WORDS=0)  ->  32/32 CLEAN
    SHARED 6000-word prefix            ->  4 BLEED, e.g. VORPAL -> "VORGYR 19"
                                           (VORPAL's "VOR" + GYRE's "GYR")

This RECONCILES this harness with bench/agentic/conc_harness.py rather than either
being wrong. That harness passes 7/8 at C=8 with clean KV health — and its own
source says it uses DISTINCT prompts deliberately, "otherwise the prefix cache
would dedupe". It therefore cannot trigger this. It is not a weak test; it tests
a different shape.

The shared-prefix shape is the PRODUCTION one: every agentic client sends a long
common system prompt and differs only in the tail. So "the agentic harness passes"
is a statement about distinct-prompt traffic ONLY, and says nothing about
shared-prefix concurrency — which is what real clients do.

Sequential is clean at BOTH shapes, so it needs concurrency AND sharing together.

COUNT BLEED, NOT WRONG
----------------------
EXACT mode scores a correct-but-prose answer ("The project codename is MIMSY...
MIMSY 31") as WRONG. Use BLEED events for the corruption rate: 4/32 = 12.5%.

INTERPRETING RESULTS
--------------------
  solo OK == N and concurrent all OK      -> clean
  solo OK == N but concurrent WRONG/BLEED -> CONCURRENCY BUG (the point of this)
  solo already failing                    -> fix the probe or the model config
                                             FIRST; the run tells you nothing
